# Score! :: Known Issues

* The `Speed` as shown by the Add'On doesn't matches exactly what's shown on the NavBall.
	+ The NavBall rounds the value to the nearest (1.22 -> 1.2 ; 1.27 -> 1.3), while the Add'On uses the **exact** value on the computations.
	+ This means that the Add'On will compute the Score more accurately!
